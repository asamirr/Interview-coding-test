# Instructions

The script uses files. "in.txt" takes the input just like how it was formatted in the example testcase. "out.txt" is the generated output of the script.

To test the script all you have to do is ```cd Auction``` then run the script ``` python auction.py``` and check the "out.txt" file every time you change the input in the "in.txt".

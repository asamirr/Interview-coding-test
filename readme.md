# Two challenges solved included in this repo.

1- Rest-Boilerplate-master is the app I built for the Petstore challenge. Built using Python, Flask and SQLite. Also, I used Sean Bradley's Flask REST APIs CRUD template.

2- Auction is a Python script for the Generalized Second Price Auction challenge.
